        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love a bit of everything, from science to building startups, finance to enconomy! I think the world has countless interesting topics to explore, making it impossible for me to choose!</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading, physical activities, and movies!</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
         <p> • I've built a web application,  <a href="https://www.wishwatch.store/" target="_blank">WishWatch</a>. It tracks prices across multiple stores for you.
             All you need to do is adding the URLs from your wishlist items, We watch the prices hourly then we notify you once it reaches your target price. 
        <p> • After one year and 8 months in Medhesion, I decided to quit my job to focus more on my solopreneurship journey.
        <p>• Since September 2023, I had been working at a biotech startup called <strong>Medhesion</strong>. My supervisor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kubeslaboratory/home" target="_blank">Dr. Paul Kubes</a> started this startup at his lab at the University of Calgary. At Medhesion, we develop and test therapeutics for patients suffering from post-surgical adhesions. My role is to test the newly synthesized drugs in vitro in mouse cells.</p>
        <p>I do a lot of imaging and data analysis. Meanwhile, I study finance to better understand the life sciences ecosystem and the economy in general.</p>

        <p>• During my undergrad, I did research in <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/labs/reparative-neuroinflammation/home" target="_blank"> Dr Wee Yong</a>'s lab wehere I studied demylinating lesions in animal models of multiple sclerosis.</a></p>

        <h2>Core skills</h2>
        <p> Confocal microscopy imaging, in vitro exepriments, data analysis, python.</p>
        <p> <strong>Most importantly:</strong> Being adaptable and a fast-learner. I can switch my focus to a new topic and learn it fast! I know how to use AI tools.
        <h2>Awards</h2>
        <p>[April 2024-April 2025] - Mitacs accelerate - Awarded to do my one year internship at Medhesion. </p>
        <p>[Summer 2022] - Alberta MS Network Summer Studentship - Awarded to conduct my research project at Wee Yong Lab.</p>
        <p> [Summer 2022] - Undergraduate Summer Studentship -  Awarded by Alberta Innovates to conduct my summer research.</p>
        <p> [Fall 2019] - Presiden's Admission scholarship. Awarded to start my bachelor degree in neuroscience at university of Calgary.</p>
        <h2>Fun facts</h2>
        <p> I dropped out of medical school after 3 semesters and right after, immigrated to Canada. </p>
        <p> I love classical books and old movies. <p>
        <p> To stay healthy, I practice brazilian jiu jitsu. <p>
